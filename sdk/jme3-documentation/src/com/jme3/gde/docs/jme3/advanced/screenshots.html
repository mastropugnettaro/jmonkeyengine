<p>

The com.jme3.app.state.ScreenshotAppState enables your users to take screenshots of the running game.
</p>

<p>
You activate this feature as follows in your simpleInitApp() method:

</p>
<pre>ScreenshotAppState screenShotState = new ScreenshotAppState&#40;&#41;;
this.stateManager.attach&#40;screenShotState&#41;;</pre>

<p>
The default screenshot key is KeyInput.KEY_SYSRQ, alos known as &quot;System Request / Print Screen&quot; key. On Mac keyboards, this key does not exist, so on Mac <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> you take screenshots using Command+Shift+3 (fullscreen) or Command+Shift+4 (windowed: press space to select a window and then click).
</p>

<p>
The screenshot is saved to the user directory.
